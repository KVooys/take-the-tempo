## The road left behind

It has been a chaotic couple of weeks for FABTCG. First, the Pro Tour Lille had a pretty diverse field but an all Briar top 4. Literally the day after at the Calling Lille, the biggest boogieman of the Classic Constructed format, Prism, finally made Living Legend, being held back at 998 points for what feels like forever.

Now with Nationals only days away for most of us, it is time to pick a deck that might do well in this shaken up field.

My top contender right now is Oldhim. I'll quickly describe the playstyle(s), the card choices and the matchups.

## Glorious purpose

[Sample decklist](https://fabdb.net/decks/DBLgnynE)

While Oldhim failed to put anyone in the Pro Tour top 8, there were 4 of them in the top 16. One of the reasons for this was probably that the Prism matchup is absolutely, soul-crushingly awful. Now that Prism is gone, Oldhim might finally get some time in the sun, finally having found a metagame where he can actually compete against every deck.

In a new, unsolved metagame, people often reach for straightforward, proactive decks, and while Oldhim is definitely not one of those decks, it has a lot of tools to beat those strategies. With Crown of Seeds and Rampart of the Ramâ€™s Head, Oldhim has such good recurring defensive potential that they can simply fatigue people out of the game if the opponents fool around too much. Winter's Wail remains one of the most efficient weapons in the game, so Oldhim will always have something to do.

There are many ways to build Oldhim, ranging from full aggro to full fatigue, so it's unlikely that the optimal build will be found before Nationals. It's probably safest to not go full fatigue right now, since the likelihood of draws is pretty high, which would be disastrous for your top 8 chances.

## Shields up

<img class="card-in-text" alt="Winter's Wail" src="/images/cards/winterswail.png"/>

Winter's Wail is probably the most important card in the Oldhim deck. The basic strategy against any deck that can out-aggro you is to defend with all your cards but one blue Ice card, then swing back with Winter's Wail. 4 is awkward to defend for most decks, and the Frostbite token can really slow things down for decks that rely on a lot of red cards like Fai and Briar. It's also a great weapon for fatigue situations, since the efficiency of the constant hammering for 4 with just 1 card cannot be matched by most other classes.

Rampart is Crown of Seeds' best friend. When you pitch for Crown, you will often have a resource left over to pump into Rampart, giving you an extra defense which can be important to block awkward attack values like 4 (Snatch and most other red 0 cost attacks) and 1 (against Ninja mostly).
The somewhat niche ability is that Rampart can be used to block multiple times if the opponent breaks the chain, but currently the only deck that does that often is Dash. Against three Pistol shots, it gives Rampart a strong 6 defense for the cost of just 1 blue.

<img class="card-in-text" alt="Stalagmite, Bastion of Isenloft" src="/images/cards/stalagmite.png"/>

On the other side of the spectrum, Stalagmite is there for when we want to spend less resources on defense and more on offensive tempo plays. Giving a Frostbite in the defend step can be crucial against a lot of decks, possibly preventing Pummels or stopping a Rosetta Thorn follow-up. A good metric to use is whether you have resources to spare for Rampart 3 or more times in a game; if you don't, then Stalagmite is probably the better choice for that matchup.

<img class="card-in-text" alt="Sledge of Anvilheim" src="/images/cards/sledge.png"/>

And finally, if we're not looking to defend with a shield at all, or just want to race, we can add the Sledge. It goes almost too perfectly with Zealous Belting, allowing an attack turn of 5 + 6 with 2 blue cards. 
It's also a solid way to spend your Tunic resource in the more grindy matchups, where you want to use a lot of cards to defend anyway.

## The bread and butter

While there are certainly some nice equipments to choose from, as we saw above, there is not much to say about most of Oldhim's maindeck card choices. The majority of the deck will be blue cards that defend for 3 and preferably are either Earth or Ice. This is because of the nature (no pun intended) of the deck; you simply cannot use Winter's Wail if you have too few Ice cards, and a fused Oaken Old is crucial to gain a vantage point in many matchups. I've found that 15 Ice cards is a good number, but higher is certainly nice; that way, you can even shave 1 or 2 in matchups where you don't rely on Winter's Wail. Earth cards are less important, but if you play more of them, you can more often use a fused Oaken Old first cycle, without pitchstacking, allowing for tempo gains that can feel very unfair.

## The real force of nature

There is one yellow card in the deck and it's a personal favourite. Autumn's Touch might not look very exciting, but it does a lot of important things for the strategy. First of all, it has 3 defense and is an Earth card, which is already two things we need. But then, it also has 6 attack, which matters for Zealous Belting and Rouse the Ancients. And if that's not enough, it allows Oldhim to activate a double reaction by pitching this and an Ice card, after which you still have 2 resources left over to use Crown or something else. This is a good way to outgrind even the grindiest of decks in the very late stages of a game.

## The hard hitters

The rest of the deck, so the part that's not yellow or blue, is full of big, hard hitting attacks. There are a few directions one can take here; 
- more big numbers like red Glacial Footsteps
- more Go Agains like Zealous Belting
- more defensive cards like Biting Gale

## Conclusion

The Oldhim deck has a lot of great options and various ways to be built, and despite its defensive nature, it can quickly turn the corner and switch plans, which makes it a very exciting playstyle. I'm certainly looking forward to playing Oldhim at Nationals this year.

Until then!
