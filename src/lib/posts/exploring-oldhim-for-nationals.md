## The road left behind

It has been a chaotic couple of weeks for FABTCG. First, the Pro Tour Lille had a pretty diverse field but an all Briar top 4. Literally the day after, at the Calling Lille, the biggest boogieman of the Classic Constructed format, Prism, finally made Living Legend, being held back at 998 points for what feels like forever.

Now with Nationals only days away for most of us, it is time to pick a deck that might do well in this shaken up field.

One of my top contenders right now is Oldhim. I'll briefly describe the playstyles and the card choices below.

## Glorious purpose

[Sample decklist](https://fabtcg.com/decklists/ryan-rich-oldhim---battle-hardened-columbus-4-9-22/)

While Oldhim failed to put anyone in the Pro Tour top 8, there were 4 of them in the top 16. One of the reasons for this was probably that the Prism matchup is absolutely, soul-crushingly awful. Now that Prism is gone, Oldhim might finally get some time in the sun, having found himself in a metagame where he can actually compete against every deck.

In a new, unsolved metagame, people often reach for straightforward, proactive decks, and while Oldhim is definitely not one of those decks, it has a lot of tools to beat those strategies. With Crown of Seeds and Rampart of the Ramâ€™s Head, Oldhim has such good recurring defensive potential that they can simply fatigue people out of the game if the opponents fool around too much. Winter's Wail remains one of the most efficient weapons in the game, so Oldhim will always have something to do.

There are many ways to build Oldhim, ranging from full aggro to full fatigue, so it's unlikely that the optimal build will be found before Nationals. It's probably safest to not go full fatigue right now, since the likelihood of draws is pretty high, which would be disastrous for your top 8 chances.

I'll analyze the equipment choices first, then the maindeck, and finally the major choices in terms of sideboarding.

## Shields up

For equipment, there are quite a few auto-includes: Winter's Wail,  Fyendal's Spring Tunic, Crown of Seeds, Crater Fist, Ironhide Legs and some amount of Arcane Barrier equipment; you should always play these, so I will not discuss them further. The major choices are in the weapon and/or shield slots:

<img class="card-in-text" alt="Rampart of the Ram's Head" src="/images/cards/rampart.png"/>

Rampart is Crown of Seeds' best friend. When you pitch for Crown, you will often have a resource left over to pump into Rampart, giving you an extra defense which can be important to block otherwise awkward attack values like 7, 4 and 1.
The somewhat niche ability is that Rampart can be used to block multiple times if the opponent breaks the chain, but currently the only deck that does that often is Dash. Against three Pistol shots, it gives Rampart a strong 6 defense for the cost of just 1 blue, but don't expect this property to come up often against other decks.

<img class="card-in-text" alt="Stalagmite, Bastion of Isenloft" src="/images/cards/stalagmite.png"/>

On the other side of the spectrum, Stalagmite is here for when we want to spend less resources on defense and more on offensive tempo plays. Giving a Frostbite in the defend step can be crucial against a lot of decks, preventing Pummels or stopping a follow-up weapon swing. A good metric to use is to check games where you only use Rampart a few times; look at those situations and calculate if a Frostbite would have prevented more than 1 damage. If it did, then Stalagmite is probably the better choice in that matchup.

And finally, if we're not looking to defend with a shield at all, or just want to race, we can add the Sledge. It goes almost too perfectly with Zealous Belting, allowing an attack turn of 5 + 6 with 2 blue cards. 
It's also a solid way to spend your Tunic resource in the more grindy matchups, where you want to use a lot of cards to defend anyway.

## The blue bread and butter

While there are certainly some nice equipment options to choose from, there is not much to choose about most of Oldhim's maindeck card choices. The majority of the deck will be blue cards that defend for 3 and preferably are either Earth or Ice. This is because of the nature (no pun intended) of the deck; you simply cannot use Winter's Wail if you have too few Ice cards, and a fused Oaken Old is crucial to gain a vantage point in many matchups. 

I've found that 15 Ice cards is a good number, but higher is certainly nice; that way, you could even shave 1 or 2 in matchups where you don't rely on Winter's Wail. Earth cards are less important, but if you play more of them, you can more often use a fused Oaken Old during the first cycle, without pitchstacking, allowing for tempo gains that can feel very unfair and that might cause your opponents to call you "always lucky" and other such things.

## The real force of nature

<img class="card-in-text" alt="Autumn's Touch (Yellow)" src="/images/cards/autumnyellow.png"/>

There is only one yellow card that sometimes makes the deck and it's a personal favourite. Autumn's Touch might not look very exciting, but it does a lot of important things for the strategy. First of all, it has 3 defense and is an Earth card, which is already two things we need. But then, it also has 6 attack, which matters for Zealous Belting and Rouse the Ancients. And if that's not enough, it allows Oldhim to activate a double reaction by pitching this and an Ice card, after which you still have 2 resources left over to use Crown or something else. This is a good way to outgrind even the grindiest of decks in the very late stages of a game.

## The three paths ahead

The rest of the deck, so the part that's not yellow or blue, is full of hard hitting attacks and efficient defensive cards. There are quite a few staples you'll always want to play, like Oaken Old, Spinal Crush, Oasis Respite and Sink Below, since they are just too good at their job. I will not discuss these in depth, since you'll see them in every single Oldhim decklist anyway. I'll once again focus on the choices instead. 

There are a few directions one can take here; 
- more big numbers, like Glacial Footsteps
- some Go Agains, like Zealous Belting
- more defensive cards, like Biting Gale 

## More big numbers

<img class="card-in-text" alt="Glacial Footsteps (Red)" src="/images/cards/ELE016.width-450.png"/>

In a lot of matchups, you want to get the opponent's life total down as soon as possible. Sending big, possibly Dominated attacks their way is one of the best ways to do that. Oldhim already plays a lot of big blue attacks that can fill this role a little bit, but he has access to a lot of red ones as well, like Macho Grande, Thunder Quake, Glacial Footsteps and even Pulverize. Of these, I like Glacial Footsteps best; it's an efficient card to play even without the Ice fusion. Pulverize is the hardest hitting, but also the most awkward one; the deck can't reliably have access to 10 resources, and Heaving comes at a pretty high cost and can be very unnatural, since that means you can't use Crown.

## Some Go Agains

<img class="card-in-text" alt="Zealous Belting (Red)" src="/images/cards/MON293.width-450.png"/>

In matchups where Oldhim wants to apply pressure, but also wants to get some of the opponent's cards out of their hand, the Go Agains can be nice. There are three good ones available: Rouse the Ancients, Enlightened Strike and Zealous Belting. If this plan is part of your strategy, I would recommend playing all three; you really want to do a Go Again attack followed by a weapon attack on as many turns as you can. Rouse the Ancients and Zealous Belting give you a small amount of deckbuilding restrictions, but you probably play enough big attacks already to match these. Take note that Rouse can easily be a good second cycle card as well, since it can be set up in the pitch stack with a bunch of big blue attacks.

## More defensive cards

<img class="card-in-text" alt="Biting Gale (Red)" src="/images/cards/ELE007.width-450.png"/>

Let's face it, a major part of the current metagame is aggressive. Having some extra ways to defend can be a good strategy. There are many options available, but most involve extra Defense Reactions like Biting Gale, Fate Foreseen, Staunch Response and Turn Timber. Biting Gale is the most exciting one among these for me, because when combined with an Ice card, you can Ice fuse it and then Ice react, which can often stop an otherwise wide aggro turn in its tracks. One thing to note here is to not go too overboard with defense; you want to be able to swap out all defensive cards against the Wizards.

## Conclusion

And that wraps up the major deckbuilding decisions for Oldhim.
The deck has a lot of options and various ways to be built, and despite its defensive nature, it can quickly turn the corner and switch plans, which makes it a very exciting playstyle that doesn't get old. I'm certainly looking forward to playing Oldhim at Nationals this year.

Until then!
