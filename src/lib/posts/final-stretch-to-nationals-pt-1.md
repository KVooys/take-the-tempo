## The road left behind

It has been a chaotic couple of weeks for FABTCG. First, the Pro Tour Lille had a pretty diverse field but an all Briar top 4. Literally the day after at the Calling Lille, the biggest boogieman of the Classic Constructed format, Prism, finally made Living Legend, being held back at 998 points for what feels like forever.

Now with Nationals only days away for most of us, it is time to analyze the decks that might do well in this shaken up field.

This article is part 1 of a series and will be covering the following decks:
- Briar
- Dash
- Oldhim


## The mountain stands tall

Briar has really seen it all at this point. They have withstood multiple bannings, an errata of the Embodiment of Earth ability, and multiple format-warping expansion sets, and yet never even left the higher tiers of the metagame. In fact, Briar dominated the most recent Pro Tour, being both the most played CC deck and the one with the best results. This makes Briar a very good and safe choice for Nationals.

For those who have been out of the loop for the past year: Briar is an aggro-combo deck, which looks to abuse the +3 attack buff of Channel Mount Heroic combined with a lot of 0-cost attacks that have or can gain Go Again, allowing for massive 20+ damage turns. Even without Channel Mount Heroic in play, Briar can still apply pressure with the play pattern of non-attack -> attack -> Rosetta Thorn. This makes the deck very reliable.

It remains to be seen whether Briar will have any really bad matchups in the new metagame. The deck is resource-light, because all attacks cost 0, but it still has to have a bunch of blue Earth cards just to pay for Channel Mount Heroic. Because of this, the deck can sometimes stumble against an avalanche of Frostbite tokens or Channel Lake Frigid, which means there might be Oldhims, Lexis and Iyslanders looking to prey upon this weakness.


## Shields up

While Oldhim failed to put anyone in the Pro Tour top 8, there were 4 of them in the top 16. One of the reasons for this was probably that the Prism matchup is absolutely, soul-crushingly awful. Now that Prism is gone, Oldhim might finally get some time in the sun.

In a new, unsolved metagame, people often reach for straightforward, proactive decks, and while Oldhim is definitely not one of those decks, it has a lot of tools to beat those strategies. With Crown of Seeds and Rampart of the Ramâ€™s Head, Oldhim has such good recurring defensive potential that they can simply fatigue people out of the game if the opponents fool around too much. Winter's Wail remains one of the most efficient weapons in the game, so Oldhim will always have something to do.

There are many ways to build Oldhim, ranging from full aggro to full fatigue, so it's unlikely that the optimal build will be found before Nationals. It's probably safest to not go full fatigue right now, since the likelihood of draws is pretty high, which would be disastrous for your top 8 chances.

## Guns blazing

Dash made strong appearances at both the Pro Tour and the recent Callings, putting up good results despite being not very popular (yet?).

Dash is one of the rare decks in this game that can truly play multiple roles. There's the slow and steady item setup plan, which looks to end the game with lots of gunshots powered by multiple Induction Chambers and Plasma Purifiers. And then there's the aggressive Boost plan, which will usually end the game in just a few turns, and with very little cards left in the deck, with huge attacks like Maximum Velocity powered up by Teklo Pounder.

Because of that nature, it's hard for a deck to truly be good against Dash, making it a solid choice as well. People really need to know what Dash is planning before the game starts, or they will sideboard poorly. Having a bunch of defensive cards in your deck when Dash is looking to slowly set up is a recipe for disaster. 


## Conclusion

So far, we've seen three strong decks that will surely be showcased at the top tables of Nationals. The next iteration of this series will include the Uprising heroes: 
- Fai 
- Dromai
- Iyslander

Until then!
