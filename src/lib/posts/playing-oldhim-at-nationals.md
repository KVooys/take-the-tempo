excerpt: My experience playing Oldhim at Nationals 2022.

## Precipice

For a few days, I was doubting whether I should publish this article, since I am not too happy with my results at Nationals.
I decided to write it anyway because it gives a nice peek into tournament preparation, execution and the pitfalls in both. I ended up playing Oldhim for Nationals 2022 and will talk about my strategies and experiences doing so.

[My Nationals decklist](https://fabdb.net/decks/zqkANjgl)

As discussed in my [previous article](https://www.takethetempo.com/blog/exploring-oldhim-for-nationals), there are many flavours of Oldhim available in Classic Constructed. I have experimented with a few different versions and this is the list I ended up with.

The deck itself is basically a 51 card core, and then it has 2 9 card sideboards:
- Proactive
  - 3 Endless Winter
  - 3 Glacial Footsteps (red)
  - 3 Zealous Belting
- Defensive/disruptive
  - 3 Chokeslam (red)
  - 3 Command and Conquer
  - 3 Sink Below


I liked the proactive plan versus decks like Dromai, Iyslander and the other Guardians. The disruptive plan is for decks like Briar and Fai. 
Of course the plan is a bit more intricate than that, but this is the high-level plan. I'll discuss details per matchup later.
I playtested quite a bit on Talishar.net, where I faced mostly Fais and Briars.

Two things of note:
- The decklist does not have many defensive cards (no Staunch Response, for instance) because these cards have felt a bit clunky and are only really good in the Guardian mirrors.
- I had Enlightened Strike in the deck for the past few months, but decided that it was never that impressive, so I replaced them with the 3 red Glacial Footsteps a few days before Nationals. 
 
These two choices were probably suboptimal and I will dive into it later.


## The events and matchups

I finished 3-3 in the Nationals main event, and then 3-2 in the PTQ side event on day 2. Overall, I was a bit disappointed by my results, but looking back, I know exactly where it all went wrong. I have summarized my results over both days in the table below:

| Matchup         | Wins | Losses | Percentage  |
|-----------------|------|--------|-------------|
| Fai (Emberblade)| 1    | 0      | 100%        |
| Katsu           | 1    | 0      | 100%        |
| Briar           | 1    | 0      | 100%        |
| Rhinar          | 1    | 0      | 100%        |
| Viserai         | 1    | 1      | 50%         |
| Oldhim mirror   | 1    | 1      | 50%         |
| Fai (Kodachi)   | 0    | 3      | 0%          |

### On the Oldhim mirror

<img class="card-in-text" alt="Endless Winter" src="/images/cards/endless.png"/>

Both my Oldhim opponents were more defensive than me, having 6 Staunch Responses in their deck, which may have given them an edge. Also, I misboarded. From earlier discussions with other Oldhim players, I came up with this plan for the mirror:
- 3 Sink Below
- 3 Glacial Footsteps (red)
- 3 Zealous Belting
- 3 Endless Winter
- take out 3 Spinal Crush
- Sledge of Anvilheim

The simple reason is that Endless Winter is a fine 4-for-8 and it's a good card to Pummel, whereas Spinal Crush never does anything useful besides raw damage. Of course, I completely forgot to take out the Spinal Crushes both matches, saw them in both of my opening hands, and immediately felt awful about it both times. A quick solution to this is to write down your sideboard plan, print it out and actually bring it to the tournament. Unfortunately I only managed steps 1 and 2 of that plan. Other than that, both matches were really close still, so I don't feel too bad.


### On Briar

Versus Briar I boarded in:
- 3 Sink Below
- 3 Chokeslam (red)
- 3 Command and Conquer
- Stalagmite (although either shield is a good choice here imo)
- Nullrune Boots

It's absolutely shocking to me that I only faced Briar once, since it was by far the most popular deck both days. I like the Briar matchup a lot. I think as Oldhim, you have to play it midrange-style, defending a lot while also finding windows for Spinal Crush, Chokeslam, Channel Lake Frigid and Hypothermia. If you can save one of these effects to stop a Channel Mount Heroic turn, you're pretty much set up to win the damage race. Even so, the game often can go long enough that your arsenalled or pitchstacked Oaken Old comes back to bite them in the lategame.

### On Viserai

Versus Viserai I boarded in:
- 3 Sink Below
- 3 Glacial Footsteps (red)
- 3 Command and Conquer
- Stalagmite
- Nullrune Boots

I still am in doubt about this matchup, and it mostly depends on how the Viserai plays it. If they go for the traditional non-attack -> attack -> Rosetta Thorn every turn, you can easily defend until they run out of Mauvrion Skies, and the Frostbite from Winter's Wail is often good to provide a bit of disruption. 

On the other hand, if they go for a more setup style plan, taking turns off to build Runechants and then going for big 20+ damage turns afterwards, it becomes much more close and much more interesting. As the Oldhim player, you want to provide maximum pressure to really punish their off turns. Because of this, I think Sink Below should not be part of the strategy, and it should probably be replaced by another big attack (Endless Winter or Chokeslam, for instance). I still think Oldhim might be favoured against either plan, but there is definitely some optimizing to do here. Fun detail: the game I lost, my opponent had a 6-card Sonata with the perfect 3-3 split, so you can't feel too bad about that.

### On Fai

Versus Fai I boarded in:
- 3 Sink Below
- 3 Chokeslam
- 3 Command and Conquer

On Talishar.net, Fai is an extremely popular deck. The problem is that the version that I saw online was the Draconic version, with Searing Emberblade and Spreading Flames as its notable cards.
In contrast, the version that was most prevalent in my Nationals was the [Kodachi Fai deck George Rodger played in the UK](https://fabtcg.com/decklists/george-rodger-fai-deck---united-kingdom-national-championship-091722/) and the play pattern is wildly different. I felt very much caught off-guard when I played against it for the first time and proceeded to lose twice more over the weekend to it, for good measure.
The problems here are both in sideboarding and play strategy.

<img class="card-in-text" alt="Searing Emberblade" src="/images/cards/UPR046.width-450.png"/>

Versus Emberblade Fai, Chokeslam is an impressive card, shutting down all their Spreading Flames into multiple Lava Burst nonsense turns with ease. Hypothermia can shut down a wide turn before it even started. The recurring Frostbite from Winter's Wail is good against them, since they are kind of resource-intensive and low on blues. Finally, their medium turns are easy to block out completely. All in all, I consider this matchup easy to medium for Oldhim and I feel pretty confident about it with the main strategy of defending with most cards and then attacking back with Winter's Wail or a disruptive attack every turn.

<img class="card-in-text" alt="Harmonized Kodachi" src="/images/cards/U-WTR78.width-450.png"/>

The difference versus Kodachi Fai is literally night and day. Chokeslam often doesn't prevent more than a few damage points. Hypothermia does not shut down many cards at all. The Frostbite from Winter's Wail is still good occasionally, but they can just as easily find a second blue with Belittle and be on their way. In short, it feels like my Oldhim deck is not capable of applying enough disruption against this version, so playing full defensive without hammering back, trying to go into a fatigue-style lategame, is probably the correct strategy. There might be a few exceptions to this: Spinal Crush, Channel Lake Frigid and Crush the Weak (if you play it) are all very impactful and could still be played. I'd have to try this matchup more to really say a lot about it.

## Conclusion

All in all, Nationals was an awesome event and I am very happy to have been part of it, and after writing this I don't feel too bad about my results anymore. Oldhim was a good deck choice for the weekend and ended up winning our Nationals as well; unfortunately it was not me. It really is too bad I found about Kodachi Fai when it was already too late, and the main reason I didn't make top 8 in either event. The lesson here is that preparation and knowing your enemies is everything: without it, even if you play perfectly (which I didn't), people are going to outmeta you at some point.

I hope you enjoyed the article, and see you next FABTCG tournament!
