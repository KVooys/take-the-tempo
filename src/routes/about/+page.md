# About

My name is Kurt Vooys, I've been playing and organizing various competitive card games over the past 15 years.
This site is made for competitive card game enthusiasts like myself. 
Everything on here is purely my opinion and should not be taken too seriously.


The site is built with the [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) framework.
